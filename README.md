# SAFEWAY--road-accident-severity-prediction-

This is a multiclass classification project to classify severity of road accidents into three categories. this project is based on real-world data and dataset is also highly imbalanced. All the sensitive information has been excluded during data encoding and finally, the dataset has 32 features and 12316 instances of an accident. 


**Source of dataset:** https://www.narcis.nl/dataset/RecordID/oai%3Aeasy.dans.knaw.nl%3Aeasy-dataset%3A191591

The target feature is accident_severity which is a multi-class variable. The task is to classify this variable based on the other 32 features. 
The metric for evaluation is the f1-score.
